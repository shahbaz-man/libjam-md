            It will also automatically resolve colors (beginning with #).
            Gravities are mapped out using:
            (top|middle|bottom)-(left|middle|right)
            Y values on the left, X values on the right.
            You can pass code as parameters which will be executed, or colors which will be parsed, theme properties which will be parsed as literals,
            or float/integer literals which will be parsed as literals.
            Code to be executed must be passed in curly braces.
