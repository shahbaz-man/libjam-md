# [WIP] Material Design Library + Extensible Views for Java and Kotlin

### What is this?
This is a Android-like View based system for Java, written in Kotlin, with Material Design Views. This makes it easy for to implement and design Material UI.

### How do I work with it?
Just clone the library, compile it and your golden!

### Examples
Examples will come later as development progresses. As I said earlier, this project is still a work in progress so don't expect too much yet.
